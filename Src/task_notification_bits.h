//These bits are used for task notifications of events.
//In FreeRTOS, task notifications are much more resource-friendly than the
//heavyweights, like semaphores, though not as general.  But for most cases the
//task notifications will work fine.  (They can only support notification to a
//single process, and communicate via bitfield.  They are most similar to
//an 'event group', but can used to emulate other primitives.)

//There could be different definitions specific to the related processes, but I
//am just going to use one common definition since the meanings are
//intrinsically scoped to the task, so it is OK to re-use numbers here for
//different tasks.  You may alternatively prefer the task bits in the task's
//implementation's header, since logically they are part of a task's interface,
//though there are some common ones here (e.g. the serial notifications) that
//would have to be meticulously copied, made consistent, and maintained.
